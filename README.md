- 👋 Hi, I’m @Pyorsy120
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more and not be so dramatic
- 🌱 I’m currently trying to learning how to think clearly
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects which I could have enough capacity to help.
- 📫 How to reach me probably just check who was the last person to do a mistake on the main code ...
